I'm a computer science MS student at the University of Texas at Dallas researching AI/ML. I am currently advised by [Dr. Yunhui Guo](https://yunhuiguo.github.io) and work as a research collaborator with [Dr. Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io) at Harvard University.

My research is driven by a desire to move beyond pattern recognition towards true machine reasoning and planning. I focus on Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and Implicit Deep Learning, such as Deep Equilibrium Models and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. I am particularly interested in how these frameworks can enable reasoning and generalization in models to learn beyond what they were trained on.
